# Excel-Project-Datset

Worked on a project which talks about the purchase of bike based on martial status, income, Education, Region and so on. 

I began the project by creating 3 diffrent sheets titled - Working Sheet, Pivot table and Dashboard. From the First sheet(Bike Buyers), I did copy and paste into the "Working sheet" just to able to prevent mistake from the original. 

Then, I did some cleaning on the project by checking and removing duplicates, renaming the M,S(i.e MArried and Single) in the Marital Status Column, Creating a new column for age which is Age Brackets and added an If function; If L2<31 name it Adolescent otherwise place Invalid,If L2>=31 name it middle age and if L2>54 name it Old.

Futhermore, i did create a pivot tables based on income and purchase of bikes. From there i just did some copying and pasting into Dashboard sheets to create the visualization i need.

Overall, this project was fun to do and i get to work on how to create a dashboard in excel
